sample element animation with js
quick javascript example of animating absolute style properties on DOM elements to see them move around the screen, and swap locations in document
good for dynamic pages with features like user-selectable element placement. frames and timescales can be easily changed.

I use Jekyll to run, just goto directory and run jekyll serve
